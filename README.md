# PAC-Proposal-Template
Jefferson Lab Program Advisory Committee (PAC) Proposal LaTeX Template

With input from the lab's Program Advisory Committee, we have put together a standard template for people to use for their proposals.    Authors of course may make changes to the layout as needed for clarity, but should ensure all the topics and beamtime information is provided.   This this information in a consistant location makes easy for the readers to refer back to the proposal and by providing an outline, hopefully key pieces of information, such as a dicussion of systematic uncertainties wouldn't be omitted.

This template is meant to be a living document and authors are encouraged to suggest improvements.

This template was crewated on a MAC with the following package: https://www.tug.org/mactex/ and has also been tested on Overleaf.    It is intended to be used with pdflatex and bibtex.
