# PAC-Proposal-Template
Jefferson Lab Program Advisory Committee (PAC) Proposal LaTeX Template

With input from the lab's Program Advisory Committee, we have put together a standard template for people to use for their proposals.    User may make changes to the layout if needed for clarity, but should follow the general format of the template to help making sure all needed information is provided and is in a consistant location making it easy for the reader to refer back to the proposal.
